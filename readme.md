This is demo project of a pagination with React and Reflux on client-side and lumen on a server-side (php micro-framework from laravel).

NEXT: Upgrading this example with ReactRouter (so that web application is able to show single article and its comments).

----------------

It has now ReactRouter. It does not show both single article and comments though, but only comments. I am sill struggling how to pass props from one route to another (so I don't have to call a server to get a data about single article again).

On the other side, pagination component is reused (articles list and comments list).

NEXT: submiting a comment (dealing with form, validation, etc).
